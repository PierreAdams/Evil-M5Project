# ESP32 Slave and Standalone

## Explaination

This code is designed to run on any ESP32 to be used with or near Evil-M5Project.
- Wardriving Slave: Each ESP32 collects SSIDs of nearby access points (APs) on a specific channel or can hop between configured channels. 
- Sniffer Slave : Each ESP32 collects EPAOL and beacon probes around on a specific channel.
- EvilChatMesh relay : Each ESP32 act as a relay as a part of the mesh.
- Portal Slave : Standalone version of the portal fonctionnality.
- Auto-Deauther : Standalone version of Auto-Deauther that can be used with Sniffer slave to stimulate EAPOL capture.

You can add multiple ESP32 devices to improve the accuracy and strength of the scan/sniff, static slave stay on one channel, preventing lost of packet due to hopping. 

Devices with external antennas can enhance the performance, it show better result due to external antenna than M5Stack devices.
You can monitor most Wi-Fi channel on 2.4GHz without hoping with 14 esp32.

Cardputer use the GPS to link each reiceived information to a CSV compatible with Wigle in wardriving.
Or create a pcap file with all EAPOL captured inside.

## Slave and Standalone code 

### `slave_deauth_hopping.ino`
This script handles a slave device that performs deauthentication (deauth) attacks on different WiFi channels dynamically, constantly changing the channel (hopping). ESP32-C5 version can deauth on 5.8Ghz. Version AtomS3 print information on screen. 

### `slave_deauth_static.ino`
This script performs deauthentication attacks on a static WiFi channel. The slave stays on a single channel to execute its attacks.

### `slave_gps_channel_static.ino`
Designed to be used with Wardriving Master. This script enables the slave to collect GPS data while remaining on a static WiFi channel. It can be used for scenarios where geolocating access points on a specific channel is required.

### `slave_gps_hopping.ino`
Designed to be used with Wardriving Master. This script combines WiFi channel hopping with GPS data collection. The device dynamically switches channels while sending detected APs. Version AtomS3 print information on screen. 

### `slave_sniffer_channel_static.ino`
Designed to be used with Handshake Master. EAPOL sniffer that remains on a static WiFi channel. It captures EAPOL packets on this channel and send it to cardputer for centralization of captured data.

### `EvilChatMesh-relay.ino`
Designed to be used with EvilChatMesh. Relay for the EvilChatMesh network, it can be used to extend the range of the network. Version AtomS3 print information on screen. 

### `slave_portal.ino`
Standalone version of the Ecil-M5Project portal fonctionnality, usinf SPIFFS to store files and WebUi to be configured and upload files.

## Features:
- **Multi-Device Support**: Add any number of ESP32 devices to increase AP detection.
- **Channel Hopping**: Configure the ESP32 to scan on a specific channel or hop between selected channels.
- **Better Signal Strength**: ESP32 devices with external antennas improve the signal capture, making it ideal for long-range wardriving.
- **Sending to master**: Use in combination with the cardputer in wardriving master mode to collect and aggregate data from multiple ESP32 slaves.

## How it Works:
1. Deploy one or more ESP32 devices in slave mode.
2. Each device scans and captures SSID information or EAPOL on designated channels.
3. The data can be aggregated and monitored in master mode, reducing missed APs and improving overall signal strength.

## Hardware Requirements:
- Cardputer in lastest version.
- ESP32 devices (e.g., AtomS3, AtomS3 Lite, ESP32-C3, WEMOS D1 Mini)
- External antenna (optional for better performance)
